		<h3>8.&nbsp; Annual Report &amp; Accounts&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
		<p>We believe that accounts and reports are mainly meant for overall improvement and not merely for statutory compliace. We provide an open platform to our clients to discuss the financail performance of the business activities in addition to the preparation of reports, whether montly, quarterly or annual. We also assist in tax planning exercise ahead of the year end, both for direct and indirect taxes. We take the opportunity to discuss with our clients the financial performance of the business activities when assisting with the preparation of the quarterly or annual reports and if so required, to review the tax planning exercise ahead of the year-end and this includes all taxation planning pertaining to the Self-Assessment System, which is now consistently applied worldwide.</p>
