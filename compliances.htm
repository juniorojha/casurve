              <br />
          </li>
		  <li>The address of the Website can be different from the name of   the firm. But it should not amount to soliciting clients or   professional work or advertisement of professional attainments or   services. The Website address should be as near as possible to the   individual name/trade name, firm name of the Chartered Accountant in   practice or firm of Chartered Accountants in practice. The Committee on   Ethical Standard &amp; Unjustified Removal of Auditors (CESURA) of ICAI   will decide in case there is any difficulty.<br />
